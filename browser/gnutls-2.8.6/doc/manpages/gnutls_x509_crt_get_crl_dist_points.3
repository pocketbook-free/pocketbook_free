.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_crl_dist_points \- This function returns the CRL distribution points
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_crl_dist_points(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", unsigned int " seq ", void * " ret ", size_t * " ret_size ", unsigned int * " reason_flags ", unsigned int * " critical ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP structure
.IP "unsigned int seq" 12
specifies the sequence number of the distribution point (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)
.IP "void * ret" 12
is the place where the distribution point will be copied to
.IP "size_t * ret_size" 12
holds the size of ret.
.IP "unsigned int * reason_flags" 12
Revocation reasons flags.
.IP "unsigned int * critical" 12
will be non zero if the extension is marked as critical (may be null)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the CRL distribution points (2.5.29.31),
contained in the given certificate.

\fIreason_flags\fP should be an ORed sequence of
GNUTLS_CRL_REASON_UNUSED, GNUTLS_CRL_REASON_KEY_COMPROMISE,
GNUTLS_CRL_REASON_CA_COMPROMISE,
GNUTLS_CRL_REASON_AFFILIATION_CHANGED,
GNUTLS_CRL_REASON_SUPERSEEDED,
GNUTLS_CRL_REASON_CESSATION_OF_OPERATION,
GNUTLS_CRL_REASON_CERTIFICATE_HOLD,
GNUTLS_CRL_REASON_PRIVILEGE_WITHDRAWN,
GNUTLS_CRL_REASON_AA_COMPROMISE, or zero for all possible reasons.

This is specified in X509v3 Certificate Extensions. GNUTLS will
return the distribution point type, or a negative error code on
error.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP and updates &\fIret_size\fP if
&\fIret_size\fP is not enough to hold the distribution point, or the
type of the distribution point if everything was ok. The type is
one of the enumerated \fBgnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t\fP.  If the
certificate does not have an Alternative name with the specified
sequence number then \fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP is
returned.

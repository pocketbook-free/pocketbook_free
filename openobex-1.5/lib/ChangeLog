2000-10-16  Pontus Fuchs  <pontus.fuchs@tactel.se>

	* obex_object.c: When a header with 0 length was received 
	  obex_object_receive tried to allocate a zero-length netbuf, 
	  which ofcourse failed causing the transfer to be aborted.

	* When OBEX_Cleanup was called. Async IO instance
	  was not unregistered. Fixed!
	* Fixed a small memleak when sending objects.

	* Fixed a compile error on obex_object.c.

1999-12-05  Pontus Fuchs  <pontus@tactel.se>

	* Made some general routines to handle data before headers.
	  (ie SETPATH works now)

	* Fixed so that the socket is closed in OBEX_TransportDisconnect()

1999-11-20  Pontus Fuchs  <pontus@tactel.se>

1999-11-17  Pontus Fuchs  <pontus@tactel.se>

	  OBEX_CustomDataFeed() us used to give the OBEXlib data.
	  A new callback is used when the OBEX-lib wants to write data.

	* Made code to use OBEX to an R320 over a serial line (see
	  apps/cobex_R320.c and apps/irobex_test.c).

1999-11-16  Pontus Fuchs  <pontus@tactel.se>

	  adding a unicode header. Made OBEX_CharToUnicode() for apps
	  to use.

1999-10-28  Pontus Fuchs  <pontus@tactel.se>

	* Heavy changes to many things. Please look at my mail in the
	  OBEX mailing-list for more info.

1999-10-25  Pontus Fuchs  <pontus@tactel.se>

	* src/obex_connect.c (obex_connect_confirm): Fixed so that the
	  object created by obex_parse_connect_frame got properly
	  deleted after connect_confirm callback was called.
	* src/obex_get.c (obex_get_indication): Removed some code which
	  was not in my tree causing a compile error.

1999-10-22  Dag Brattli  <dagb@cs.uit.no>

	* src/obex_main.c (obex_status_indication): Fixed so that it just 
	  return if the body has not been allocated yet. This will happen
	  if you start a get operation, and the first packet does not
          contain any body data.	 

1999-10-22  Pontus Fuchs  <pontus@tactel.se>

	* Small change to make irobex_palm3.c work again.

1999-10-22  Pontus Fuchs  <pontus@tactel.se>

	* Many changes with GET and PUT.

1999-10-21  Dag Brattli  <dagb@cs.uit.no>

	* Fixed irda-check.m4, so it doesn't stop with an error if IrDA 
	  support is not found. Now it will continue, but you will of
	  course only get TCP support

1999-10-18  Pontus Fuchs  <pontus@tactel.se>

	* Fixed some small things in the GET statemachine.

1999-10-18  Dag Brattli  <dagb@cs.uit.no>

	* Removed irdalib, and just added netbuf.[ch] and parameters.[ch]
	  to the obex/src dir.

1999-10-08  Dag Brattli  <dagb@cs.uit.no>

	* Fixed irda-check.m4 so #define HAVE_IRDA 1 will show up in
	  config.h if you have irda support in your kernel

1999-10-08  Ole Sorslett  <oles@stud.cs.uit.no>

	* Added HAVE_IRDA ifdefs around all IrDA related code. Hopefully,
	  the code should now compile OK even on *BSD systems.

1999-10-08  Pontus Fuchs <pontus@tactel.se>

	* defined OBEX_OBJECT_MAXSTRLEN and removed hardcoded values
	* Changed obex_object_t and updated GET and PUT
	* Changed the status-indication to work when length
	  is unknown.

1999-10-07  Pontus Fuchs  <pontus@tactel.se>

	* Fixed GET.
	* Fixed PUT. After a connect self->object was not
	  empty causing putrequest to fail.
	* Added some checking to obex_put_request()
	  and obex_get_request so they now fail nicely
	  if obex_data_request() fails.
